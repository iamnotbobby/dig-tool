## ⭐ Features

Dig Tool was originally developed with the primary focus of achieving significant accuracy during the minigame. Since then, it has expanded to include several other features, such as:

* In-depth customization panel with detection settings and adjustable accuracy parameters.
* Full-fledged AFK mode (auto-walk) with a built-in walk pattern recorder, path visualizations, a reverse-engineered mathematical formula to determine the walk speed decrease given in-game after digging X items, and more.
* A lightweight OCR engine with no performance cost, integrated into Dig Tool to detect various in-game displays.
* Sleek Discord notification system with _live_ webhook updates.
* Several toggleable in-game HUD overlays that reflect real-time metrics.
* Support for external automation of Dig Tool by outputting information about Dig Tool's internal status (e.g., AHK).

and much more!
