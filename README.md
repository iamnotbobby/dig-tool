A highly configurable automation tool specifically for the ROBLOX game ["Dig"](https://www.roblox.com/games/126244816328678) where several algorithms are used in order achieve accuracy during the minigame.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only download Dig Tool from the **official** repository and website (https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool/releases). Never download from untrusted links.

## ⭐ Features

Dig Tool was originally developed with the primary focus of achieving significant accuracy during the minigame. Since then, it has expanded to include several other features, such as:

* In-depth customization panel with detection settings and adjustable accuracy parameters.
* Full-fledged AFK mode (auto-walk) with a built-in walk pattern recorder, path visualizations, a reverse-engineered mathematical formula to determine the walk speed decrease given in-game after digging X items, and more.
* A lightweight OCR engine with no performance cost, integrated into Dig Tool to detect various in-game displays.
* Sleek Discord notification system with _live_ webhook updates.
* Several toggleable in-game HUD overlays that reflect real-time metrics.
* Support for external automation of Dig Tool by outputting information about Dig Tool's internal status (e.g., AHK).

and much more!

## 📦 Installation 

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
- Download the compiled executable (.exe) from the [releases page](https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool/releases/latest). This will redirect you to the latest release. 
- No Python installation required - just run the .exe file

The executable provided is generated by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool/actions), where build attestations are generated to ensure nothing on the releases page has been tampered with by me.

> [!WARNING]
> Some antivirus programs may flag the compiled executable as malicious. These are FALSE POSITIVES. You have every right to be suspicious, and you also have the right to perform a thorough analysis of both the code and the executable provided.

### Option 2: Run from Source
- Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. 
- Clone this repository (alternatively, just download this repository as a zip): `git clone https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the application: `python main.py`
  
If you wish to also compile from source you can run: ``python compile.py`` which will compile the source using ``PyInstaller``

> [!NOTE]
> Option 1 is recommended for most users as it requires no technical setup. Choose Option 2 if you want to modify the source or prefer running from source.
