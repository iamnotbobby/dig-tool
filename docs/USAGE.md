## Getting Started

1. **Launch the Macro**

   * Start the Dig Tool Macro by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool/releases/latest) and double-clicking the executable file from your Downloads folder.

> [!WARNING]  
> If Windows Defender deletes or blocks the executable file, follow these steps:
> * Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the **Run** dialog.
> * Paste the following command into the box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
>   ```cmd
>   cmd /c "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -SignatureUpdate
>   ```
>
> This will update Defender's virus definitions. After it's done, try downloading the macro again.

2. **Select an area**

   - Click the `Select Area` button on the main GUI.

   - Your screen will darken â€” click and drag to highlight your target dig area.  
   ![Select Area Example](/assets/selection_area.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must select the bottom half of the minigame bar.
> Selecting the wrong region may cause the macro to miss hits or fail to detect movement properly.

3. **Disable Notifications Viewport in Game Settings**

Before starting the macro, you'll need to make sure `Notifications Viewport` is disabled in the in-game settings menu.

   - Open your in-game settings menu.

   - Look for the **"Notifications Viewport"** setting.  
   ![Notifications Viewport Slider](/assets/notifications_viewport_slider.png)
   - Make sure it is **disabled** (the slider should be to the **left** and appear **grey**).

4. **Start Automation**

   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or your assigned hotkey to start the macro.
   - You can pause or stop at any time by pressing the hotkey again.

## Importing Configuration Settings

Settings control your macro behavior such as detection, behavior, input delay, and sweet spot area.

![Settings Dropdown](/assets/settings_dropdown.png)
2. Click `Load Settings`.

## Importing Custom Walk Patterns

You can import `.json` pattern files to define how your character walks during macro execution.

### Steps to Import Walk Patterns

1. Open the `Behavior` dropdown menu on the main GUI.  
![Behavior Dropdown](/assets/behavior_dropdown.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Macro stops walking or digging suddenly

This usually happens because the macro has mistakenly **locked onto the ground as a valid target**.

#### How to confirm:

1. Press <kbd>F3</kbd> (or your assigned hotkey) to open the **overlay**.
2. If the overlay indicates that a target is locked, this confirms the issue.

#### How to fix:

* Zoom your **in-game camera into your characterâ€™s head**, but **do not go into first-person view**.
* This is usually enough to prevent the macro from detecting the ground as a valid target.

### Walk patterns failed to import

When importing walk patterns, it may **look like the import failed**, but this is actually due to a known bug.

#### Whatâ€™s happening:

* After you select and open a `.json` file to import, **extra file dialog windows** may open â€” one for **each pattern inside the file**.
* An error message may appear at the end.

#### What to do:

1. Simply **click `Cancel`** on each dialog that pops up.
2. After the last one, **ignore the final error message**.
3. Press the `Refresh List` button.
4. The imported walk patterns should now appear as expected.

### Windows Defender blocked or deleted the executable

Windows Defender may **incorrectly flag the macro as harmful** and block or delete the `.exe` file immediately after download.

#### How to fix:

1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Paste the following command into the box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

   ```cmd
   cmd /c "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -SignatureUpdate
   ```
3. Wait for Windows Defender to finish updating its virus definitions.
4. Re-download the macro from the [latest release](https://github.com/iamnotbobby/dig-tool/releases/latest) and try running it again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This issue is a **false positive**. The macro does not contain any malicious code.

### Hotkeys donâ€™t do anything

Sometimes the macroâ€™s hotkeys (e.g., <kbd>F1</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>F3</kbd>) may stop responding or appear to do nothing.

#### How to fix:

* Simply **close and restart the program**.
  This usually restores full hotkey functionality.

### Settings reverted after restart

Settings **do not persist automatically** between sessions.

#### What to do:

* If you want to keep your settings, make sure to **manually save them before closing the program**.
* Alternatively, you can **load your saved settings file** each time you start the macro.
