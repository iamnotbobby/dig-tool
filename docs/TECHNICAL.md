## Overview

This guide explains every setting and option available in the Dig Tool. Each setting is described in simple terms to help you understand what it does and how it affects the tool's behavior.

> [!TIP]
> You can hover over any setting in the tool to see a brief tooltip explanation. This guide provides more detailed information about each option.

## Detection Settings

These settings control how the tool finds and tracks the sweet spot in the digging mini-game.

### Line Detection

**Line Sensitivity**
- **What it does**: Controls how sharp the contrast must be to detect the moving line
- **Higher values**: Less sensitive to weak edges (more selective)
- **Lower values**: More sensitive to faint lines (may detect false positives)
- **Typical range**: 50-150
- **When to adjust**: If the tool isn't detecting the line consistently, try lowering this value

**Line Detection Offset**
- **What it does**: Moves the detected line position left or right by a specific number of pixels
- **Positive values**: Shifts the line detection to the right
- **Negative values**: Shifts the line detection to the left
- **Decimals allowed**: You can use precise values like 2.5 or -1.2
- **When to adjust**: If clicks seem slightly off-target, fine-tune this value

**Line Exclusion Radius**
- **What it does**: Creates a circular "dead zone" around the detected line where target zones are ignored
- **Purpose**: Prevents the moving line from interfering with zone detection
- **Typical range**: 5-20 pixels
- **When to adjust**: If the tool gets confused when the line passes through valid zones

### Zone Detection

**Zone Min Width**
- **What it does**: Sets the minimum pixel width for a valid target zone
- **Purpose**: Filters out tiny zones that aren't worth clicking
- **Typical range**: 50-200 pixels
- **When to adjust**: If the tool clicks on very small, insignificant zones

**Max Zone Width Percent**
- **What it does**: Sets the maximum width of a target zone as a percentage of the capture area
- **Range**: 0-200% (values above 100% allow detecting zones wider than the capture area)
- **Purpose**: Prevents detection of massive zones that might be background elements
- **When to adjust**: If the tool incorrectly selects very large areas

**Min Zone Height Percent**
- **What it does**: Requires target zones to span at least this percentage of the capture height
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Purpose**: Ensures zones are tall enough to be valid dig spots
- **When to adjust**: If the tool selects thin horizontal lines that aren't dig zones

**Sweet Spot Width Percent**
- **What it does**: Controls the width of the clickable area in the center of detected zones
- **Range**: 5-50%
- **Smaller values**: More precise clicking required
- **Larger values**: More forgiving, but less accurate
- **When to adjust**: If you're missing hits frequently, try increasing this value

### Movement Detection

**Saturation Threshold**
- **What it does**: Controls how colorful a pixel must be to be part of the initial zone search
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0 (higher = more colorful required)
- **Purpose**: Helps filter out dull background elements
- **When to adjust**: If the tool detects too much background or misses colorful dig zones

**Zone Smoothing Factor**
- **What it does**: Controls how much the target zone movement is smoothed over time
- **Range**: 0.0-2.0
- **1.0**: No smoothing (zone jumps immediately)
- **Lower values**: More smoothing (zone moves more gradually)
- **Higher values**: Less smoothing (zone follows detection more directly)
- **When to adjust**: If zone tracking is too jittery or too slow to respond

**Velocity Based Width Enabled**
- **What it does**: Automatically adjusts sweet spot width based on how fast the line is moving
- **When enabled**: Faster line movement = wider sweet spot for easier targeting
- **Purpose**: Makes it easier to hit fast-moving targets
- **When to use**: Enable if you have trouble hitting targets when the line moves quickly

**Velocity Width Multiplier**
- **What it does**: Controls how much line speed affects sweet spot width
- **Range**: 0.5-5.0
- **Higher values**: More dramatic width changes based on speed
- **Lower values**: More subtle width adjustments
- **Only works**: When "Velocity Based Width Enabled" is on

**Velocity Max Factor**
- **What it does**: Sets the maximum velocity for normalization (pixels per second)
- **Purpose**: Velocities above this value are treated as maximum speed
- **Typical range**: 1000-5000 px/s
- **When to adjust**: If velocity-based width isn't working correctly

### Advanced Detection

**Use Otsu Detection**
- **What it does**: Uses automatic threshold calculation instead of manual saturation settings
- **Benefits**: Can be more adaptive to different lighting conditions
- **Cannot be used with**: Color Picker Detection (they conflict)
- **When to use**: If manual saturation threshold isn't working well

**Otsu Min Area**
- **What it does**: Minimum area (in pixels) for detected regions when using Otsu
- **Purpose**: Filters out tiny regions that aren't valid zones
- **Only works**: When "Use Otsu Detection" is enabled

**Otsu Max Area**
- **What it does**: Maximum area (in pixels) for detected regions when using Otsu
- **Purpose**: Prevents detection of huge areas that aren't dig zones
- **Leave empty**: For no upper limit
- **Only works**: When "Use Otsu Detection" is enabled

**Use Color Picker Detection**
- **What it does**: Uses a specific color you pick to detect target zones
- **How to use**: Enable this, then click "Pick Color from Screen" to select your target color
- **Benefits**: Very precise when you know the exact color you want to detect
- **Cannot be used with**: Otsu Detection (they conflict)

**Color Tolerance**
- **What it does**: How close colors need to be to your picked color to be detected
- **Range**: 1-90
- **Higher values**: More lenient color matching
- **Lower values**: More precise color matching
- **Only works**: When "Use Color Picker Detection" is enabled

- **Only works**: When "Prediction Enabled" is on

### Input & Timing

**Post Click Blindness**
- **What it does**: How long to wait after clicking before scanning for new targets

> [!NOTE]
> Many settings have dependencies on each other. The tool will automatically disable conflicting options and show tooltips explaining why certain settings are unavailable.

> [!TIP]
> Start with default settings and adjust gradually. Most users only need to modify a few settings to get optimal performance for their setup.

> [!WARNING]
> Some settings like Debug Mode can use significant system resources. Only enable resource-intensive options when necessary.
